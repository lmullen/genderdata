This package passes R CMD check on Windows and OS X:

* This is a new submission.

* This package was created because CRAN maintainers requested that the 
  data for the `gender` package for predicting genders from first names 
  be brought into a separate package. The `gender` package will depend 
  on this package, and I will resubmit it to CRAN if this data package 
  is accepted.

* checking installed package size ... installed size is 22.5Mb 
  sub-directories of 1Mb or more: data  22.4Mb

  Since this is a data package, it will seldom need to be updated.
